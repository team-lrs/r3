## Introduction

Hi!
So what's our project all about?

Instead of giving you a boring definition, let's tell a story instead.

### The problem

Let's start with a few easy assumptions,

* let's say that you live in a house and that your house has lamps,
* let's say that you have a TV remote, or a game controler, and that this device has batteries,
* let's say that you have electric equiment, like an old PC, or a TV, a fridge, a microwave oven...

Over time some of those lamps will fail. The batteries will die out. Some of your electronic devices will break.

So as responsible citizen, instead of throwing these things away, you would like to recycle them.

But now, despite your good intentions, you may have a problem.

Most people don't know where to bring these things in for recycling, and end up accumulating them in a box somewhere, with a nice little label stating their pure eco-friendly intentions.
I myself have a small collection of broken lamps, and dead batteries :-)

### R3 to the rescue

So one day, when adding yet another lamp to the box, we had an idea.

‟You know what would be nice? Having a geo-referenced database for Eco-Locations where you could search and filter on location, category, ...„

This was one of those ideas that stay on the back of your mind, but need an extra push to come to life.
Thankfully Shift/Faro provided that opportunity.

## The app

[picture]

* So here we have a map, with locations of recycling drop-points.
* Different location markers are shown depending on recycling categories.
* You can search for eco-locations nearby, or around a selected point of interest.
* You can also filter for category, since you might be looking for something specific. (Where the hell to I drop those lamps??)

## The future

### More features

* You will be able to add multiple points of interest, so that you can plan where to drop some things based on which eco-locations are closer to your home, workplace, etc.
* You will be able to save your searches, points of interest, etc.
* Offline ready. Since you will want access to your locations on the go, it's important to keep the app working regardless of internet connection.

### Communication tool

The most exciting feature we're planning for the future is a communication tool that will allow you make anouncements like these:

* *‟I have an old phone, model XXX, in working condition that I want to part ways with. Anyone interested?„*
* *‟I take old sewing machines, regarless of condition. If you have one to throw away, please bring it to me.„*

Using a system of categories and keywords, it will also be able to identify if someone is looking for the type of item you want to get rid of, and present suggestions accordingly.

For example:

* Someone is looking for a phone, so they put up a *taker* announcement with the “phone” category. The keywords “phone” and “working condition” would be preselected by default.
* Now when you start writing you *giver* announcement about your *‟old pone in working condition„*, you will get a suggestion to give it to that user directly.

The goal is to make it easy to collaborate with others in *reusing* before we fall back to *recycling*.
